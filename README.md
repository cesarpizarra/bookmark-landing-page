# Frontend Mentor - Bookmark Landing Page Layouting Challenge Solution

This repository contains my solution to the [Bookmark Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158) challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge involved building a responsive landing page for a bookmark management application. I used the following technologies for this project:

- React JS: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for efficient and modular development.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid styling and consistent design patterns.
- Vite: A fast and lightweight build tool that provides a seamless development experience.
